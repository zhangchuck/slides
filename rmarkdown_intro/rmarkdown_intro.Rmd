### R Markdown extends the Markdown language

>- Simple syntax (learn it in 5 minutes)
>- Source code is human readable
>- Code translates in a predictable way to HTML
>- Outputs to **HTML**, or **PDF** or **Word .doc** (*PanDoc*)
>- Use your own CSS and include raw HTML in your file
>- Markdown is used in Jupyter Notebooks, Github, etc.

---

### R Markdown has additional features

>- Retains all Markdown syntax and features
>- Integrated into *RStudio*
>- Handles **LaTeX** mathematical notation (*MathJax*)
>- Place **R** code and figures directly in your RMarkdown code
>- Create slides like this presentation! (*RevealJS*)

## What is RMarkdown and why am I so hype

- Already use a lot of R
- Embed LaTeX to write math using the standard languafe
- Markdown is a subset of RMarkdown (all base features available)
- Embed R code that compiles/runs to make reproducible reports
- Translates to great LaTeX files (and HTML and Word and slides)
- Fast, integrated, low syntatical overhead

## Downsides

- Only available in RStudio (currently dominant IDE for R, but not widely supported)
- Translations are not always consistent (diff CSS, mostly a markdown problem)
- Not suitable for journal publication (although most things will translate to LaTeX)
